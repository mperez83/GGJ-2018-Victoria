# GGJ-Game-Project
Unity game submission for Global Game Jam 2018! The theme was "what home means to you", and in this game, you play as a woman who escapes imprisonment and journeys back to her home village.

Unfortunately, we could not get the build working by the end. Everything works in the editor, but building the game causes it to crash.

**How to open:**
1. [Install Unity](https://unity.com/)
2. Clone this repo to some directory on your computer
3. Open the repo folder with Unity
